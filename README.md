### Overview:
This project utilizes the LangChain library to create a language model chain that generates specific answers to questions related to exercise, workout, health, and fitness. The chain is built using Hugging Face's model from the repository "tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct."

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Install dependencies using: `pip install langchain chainlit`

### Usage:
1. Set up your Hugging Face API token:
   - Get your Hugging Face API token from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/token).
   - Replace `'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'` with your actual API token in the `LLM.py` script.

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   chainlit run LLM.py
   ```

### Input:
The script expects input questions related to health, fitness, exercise, and workout. It generates specific answers with references to exercises in an academic style suitable for an audience aged 18-25.

### Output:
The script outputs a paragraph-length response based on the provided question.

### Example Usage:
```bash
chainlit run LLM.py
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure you have proper permissions and access to the specified Hugging Face model repository.
